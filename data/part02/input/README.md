A directory `orthoExons` containing the output from `data/part01/output/fasta/*.fasta` is expected here, as well as the following files:

 - data from paragon: `PGC106.selectedAmp.tab`
 - reference tree for tapir: `tapir_ref_959genes.tre`
 - file defining closest relitives used for padding alignments to the full species set: `alternate_sp.json`
